# ShapeGame

ShapeGame is an experimental project that I've taken on in which I am attempting to build a functional game using Swift Playgrounds and my iPad Pro. The goal of this project is to not only build a game, but also experience what coding on an iPad could be like in the future. Swift Playgrounds is still no where near a professional IDE and Swift / XCode isn't even the best option when it comes to game development so there are a lot of downsides to this project. 

# The Game

The basic concept of the game as it stands right now is that the player will be presented with a board of nine colored shapes containing a value. They will also be presented with a Target Color/Shape/Value option contained on the board. Matching the shape on the board will remove it from play and the goal is to clear the gameboard. Once cleared the board will reset and a new shape and new colors will be added to the game. This repeats for five levels of difficulty after which you win. 

# YouTube

You can watch my progress of developing this game on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnDavGameDev. I try to post develompent updates on ShapeGame about every two weeks with other content related to Swift Playgrounds, Hobby Game Dev, and other topics filling in the weeks between.
